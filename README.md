## Problem Statement

Currently, Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process or non-interactive online process. The goal is to create an online interactive process to conduct video KYC, which is intuitive and self-sufficient. The KYC process should capture the user’s live photograph and their basic details like name, date of birth (DOB), address, PAN card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, and type of employment in a conversational manner. This tool should be highly inclusive and have high reach across languages and generations, irrespective of financial and education gap.
